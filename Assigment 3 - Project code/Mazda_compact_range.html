	<!-- History Summary -->
	<h4>
		The compact house concept fashionable today around the world has long been a reality in the country’s densely
		populated cities where living space comes at a premium. This spirit of compact cleverness extended to the
		Japanese car industry, where the ‘Kei’ car class was introduced by the Japanese government in 1949. Short for
		‘Keijidosha’, meaning light automobile, Kei class microcars had to fit within tight dimension regulations, and
		until 1975 have an engine no bigger than 660cc. Launched in 1960, Mazda’s first passenger car was built to these
		diminutive regulations, yet this didn’t stop Mazda’s engineers from creating a distinctive vehicle that had the
		same focus on aesthetics, reliability and comfort you’d expect from a larger car. This information was provided
		by https://www.insidemazda.co.uk/2020/08/06/mazda-at-100-small-cars-with-big-appeal/ </h4>
