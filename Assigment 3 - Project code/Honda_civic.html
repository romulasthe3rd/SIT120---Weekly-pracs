	<!-- History Summary -->

	<h4>
		It might seem odd to fawn over an economy car, but where the Honda Civic is concerned, it has earned our
		respect. When it debuted in 1972, Americans were listening to Carole King records the size of the Civic's first
		wheels. It was a weird decade, but in a country of bell-bottoms and roller skates along came a Japanese
		hatchback with a transversely mounted 1.2-liter engine. The first Civic was everything other small cars weren't.
		The Chevrolet Vega and Ford Pinto were rolling sacrifices amid an international fuel crisis, but the small and
		efficient Civic felt like perfect timing. It was also fun to drive, something that's still true today. Enjoy
		this brief history of the legendary H-badge lineage, from its humble beginnings to its high-performance
		adolescence. This information was provided by:
