    <!-- History Summary -->
    <h4>The company traces its origins back to 1899 and August Horch. The first Horch automobile was produced in 1901 in
        Zwickau, in former East Germany. In 1910, Horch was forced out of the company he had founded. He then started a
        new company in Zwickau and continued using the Horch brand. His former partners sued him for trademark
        infringement and a German court determined that the Horch brand belonged to his former company. August Horch was
        forced to refrain from using his own family name in his new car business. As the word “Horch!” translates to
        “listen!” in German, August Horch settled on the Latin equivalent of his name – “Audi!”. This information was
        provided by: https://paceautowerks.com.au/audi-history/</h4>
